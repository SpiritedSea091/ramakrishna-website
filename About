T D Ramakrishna was born on the 7th of August 1943, in a village called Galivarthangal, in the then North Arcot district of Tamil Nadu. He was born to Smt. E N Govindamma and Shri. K M Desu Naidu. At the age of 13, he moved to Bangalore with the support of his maternal uncle. In Bangalore, he worked many kinds of jobs like trading, supervising in construction, metal works etc and excelled at every one of them despite being very young. He then realised the need to complete his education and enrolled in a night school and passed his S.S.L.C exam in one year. This feat is remarkable because the exam was in an English-medium while his initial schooling had been in a Tamil-medium.

In the year 1967, he joined the Indian Telephone Industries (ITI) under pressure from family, though he was doing well in the private sector. In 1968 he married Smt T V Andal who has remained his constant support ever since. It was well before his time in the Indian Telephone Industries that his association with the trade unions and workers rights began. This led to his joining the Communist Party of India of which he is a member to this day. Having never hankered after power or pelf, he has remained committed to the service of his fellow beings in whatever small way possible by him. 

He quit the ITI in the year 1991 and became engaged in the construction industry in a full-fledged way. He is a successful builder today. His interests range from organic farming (he is a member of Green Movement in Karnataka), literature (associates with vernacular language writers), causes of elders (member of Sahaja Samruddha and founder member of Senior Citizen's Movement Ramamurthy Nagar), social service, citizens rights, primary eduction (on the verge of opening a school), and many more interests like law, music and cultural activities.
